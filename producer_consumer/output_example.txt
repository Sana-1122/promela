From the original EPOS C++ application:

PPaPbPcPdPePfPgPhPiPjPkPlPmPnPoPPpaPbPcPdPePfPgPhPiPjPkPlPmPnPoPPpaPbPcPdPePfPgP
hPiPjPkPlPmPnPoPPpaPbPcPdPePfPgPhPiPjPkPlPmPnPoPPpaPbPcPdPePfPgPhPiPjPkPlPmPnPoP
PpaPbPcPdPePfPgPhPiPjPkPlPmPnPoPPpaPbPcdThe last thread has exited!

Here "P" means the execution of the producer and "a" to "p" means the execution
of the consumer.

The output from the promela version should be something like the EPOS version.
However, instead of lower case characters, the consumer should print numbers
from 0 to 15.
